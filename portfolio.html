    <h2><center>1.1.9 Project<h2>
    <img src="1.1.9 image.JPG">
    <center><p>For my 1.1.9 Project I made a shape game where the winner is determined randomly. There is a different winner each time. When the race is over, the shapes move over to a podium and go to their corresponding spots.
	    1st place goes on the gold, 2nd on silver, and 3rd on bronze.</p>

    <center><h2>1.2.5 Project<h2>

    <center><p>For the 1.2.5 project I made a basketball drop game. The goal of the game is to drop as many basketballs into the basket within the time limit.
	    You drop the balls by pressing the corresponding number on your keyboard. Once the time runs out you no longer can drop anymore balls and the game is over.</p>

    <center><h2>Scratch Project<h2>
    <img src="scratch.jpg">   
    <p>For my scratch project, I made a dinosour jumping game. Cactus come at you randomly and you have to avoid them to try to get the highest score possible.
	    			If you hit a cactus, game over. If you die, a death screen pops up that gives you the option to re-run the game.</p>
